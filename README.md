## Overview

Simple static Web App that mocks "order food" logics. Made with React and Framer Motion for the animations. React was used in order to get more practice with it (I'm a React beginner).

User form is made by nonsense fields; I did it on purpose because I don't want to store any kind of personal/sensitive data (this is just for practicing use, so I didn't want to get troubles with GDPR or privacy stuff :D)

## My process

### Built with

- React (JS Library).
- Framer motion (animation library)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Firebase (API for getting meals from DB and for posting form to DB)

## Notes
This simple web app was made with React. But when it was developed basic React features were implemented such as:
- useState hooks
- context API for managing global state
- useEffect hooks
- custom hooks (for HTTP and form requests)
- Fragment
- React Portal (creating the cart modal)

Going further along the course I realized that somenthing could be done better... for example "context API" could be replaced by Redux and Redux toolkit, which allows me to manage global state using slices and reduce code overhead along components.
